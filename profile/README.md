# Hello, hello! 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is just an organization (weird that I have to create a whole organization just for this :sweat_smile:) I've created to compile and collect my solutions to the excellent exercises in "OOP in Python for Mathematicians" by David A. Ham, (https://object-oriented-python.github.io/index.html).

I hope to populate this with not just solutions that pass the built-in tests as well as the GitHub ones, but also hopefully some thoughts and discoveries I make in the process of completing the exercises!

For example, while completing the exercises in Chapter 3, I learnt about using outer products (this was particularly cool because while brainstorming about how I should represent something mathematically, I thought about the math I had learnt so far and which types of operations might lend itself to solving the problem I was facing, and thinking to Differential Geometry and General Relativity, my friend and I discussed tensor products and this was a beautiful Eureka! moment that had me and my friend exclaiming in lots of joy) ((of course being used as a of representation for a particular operation the exercises told me to implement 😉😉)) and a special way to traverse 2D arrays to compute something in particular (again 😉😉).

The hope is not necessarily for the reader (you) to copy my solutions but to compare and contrast how different people might come to the same results!
