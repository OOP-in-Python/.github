# OOP-in-Python

I created this organization to have a place where all of the repositories I create while following and completing the exercises in the book OOP in Python for Mathematicians (https://object-oriented-python.github.io/index.html).

There are solutions to each of the exercises in the chapters I've attempted stored in their respective repositories.
